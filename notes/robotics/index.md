g4dn.2xlarge

How much vCPUs do I need to run a g4dn.2xlarge ? What kind of quota increase request should I make in AWS in Servie
Quotas?

I need to create a scene in Isaac Sim

Isaac sim is trying to

- reduce the iteration time
- development tim
- tes your algorithms immediately on the simulated robots
  in isaac sim first and then you

Help me out.  I am a software developer in a consulting company
and I want to propose a project to my depertmant(IOT) to attract their attention for a use case of AI in Robotics
programming.
As part of approval I also want to do a 2 hours hands on demonstration of the project.

My Idea:

I want to create a robot that can pick up a ball and place it in a basket. I want to use AI to program the robot to do
this task. I want to use Isaac Sim to simulate the robot and the environment and then use the trained model to run the
robot in real world. I want to use the NVIDIA Jetson Nano or raspberry to run the model on the robot.

I am very attracted to the idea of using AI in Robotics programming. I really believe that this is the future of
robotics programming.
For the following reasons;

- reduce the iteration time
- development tim
- tes your algorithms immediately on the simulated robots in isaac sim first and then you can run it on the real robot

So I want to propose this project to my department. I want to attract their attention for a use case of AI in Robotics
programming. As part of approval I also want to do a 2 hours hands on demonstration of the project. I want to create a
robot that can pick up a ball and place it in a basket. I want to use AI to program the robot to do this task. I want to
use Isaac Sim to simulate the robot and the environment and then use the trained model to run the robot in real world. I
want to use the NVIDIA Jetson Nano or raspberry to run the model on the robot.

Help me to create a proposal paragraph for this project. I want you to highlight the greatness and benefits of training
robot in simulation by using the omniverse. You can use bullet points to highlight the benefits of using AI in Robotics
programming. It would be also great if you could somehow reference this project with IoT or Smart devices departments so that it would attract their attention
