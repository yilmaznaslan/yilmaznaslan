# Inversion Of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle used in programming to increase the modularity and flexibility of a
system. It refers to the process where the control of a system is transferred from the main program to a framework or
container. This allows the main program to be decoupled from the underlying components, making it easier to modify,
test, and maintain.

IoC can be implemented in several ways, including:

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: This is the most common form of IoC. Objects are given their dependencies at creation
  time by
  a container or factory, rather than creating them internally. This allows the system to substitute different
  implementations without changing the code that uses them.

Event-based IoC: In this approach, objects are configured to respond to events in the system. This can allow objects to
be notified of changes in other parts of the system without being tightly coupled to them.

Service Locators: This pattern can be used to provide a centralized registry of services that can be looked up at
runtime. It's another way to achieve decoupling, but it's generally considered less transparent and more difficult to
manage than DI.

Template Method Design Pattern: This approach can be used to invert the control by defining the skeleton of an algorithm
in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This way, the general algorithm is controlled by the parent class, but
the specific steps can be overridden by the child classes.

Factory Pattern: Sometimes factories can be used to achieve IoC, where object creation is abstracted into a separate
factory. This allows the system to change the way objects are created without altering the code that uses them.

### The main advantages of IoC are:

- Decoupling: By managing dependencies outside of the class, the system's components become more independent, making
  them
  easier to test and modify.

- Flexibility: IoC allows the system to easily swap or change the implementation of a class without affecting the
  classes
  that use it.

- Maintainability: The system becomes more maintainable as changes to one part of the system are less likely to affect
  other parts.
  In the context of frameworks like Spring in Java, IoC containers manage object creation, lifecycle, and dependencies,
  allowing for an elegant and flexible way to build applications.
