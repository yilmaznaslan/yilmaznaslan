## Data Structure

### 1) Linear Data Structures

### 2) Non-Linear Data Structures

- Tree Data Structure
- Graph Data Structure

#### Tree Data Structure

Tree data structure is similar to a tree we see in nature but it is upside down. It also has a root and leaves. The root
is the first node of the tree and the leaves are the ones at the bottom-most level. The special characteristic of a tree
is that there is only one path to go from any of its nodes to any other node.

Based on the maximum number of children of a node of the tree it can be –

- **Binary tree** – This is a special type of tree where each node can have a maximum of 2 children.
- **Ternary tree** – This is a special type of tree where each node can have a maximum of 3 children.
- **N-ary tree** – In this type of tree, a node can have at most N children.

#### Graph Data Structure

It is similar to the Tree data structure, with the difference that there is no particular root or leaf node, and it can
be traversed in any order.  A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) 
and a set of edges that connect
a pair of nodes.
