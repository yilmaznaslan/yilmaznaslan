# Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: An array is a container object that holds a **fixed** number of values of a single type. The length of an
   array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is **fixed**. 
      ```
         int[] ages = new int[5];
      ```

2. **ArrayList**: A dynamic array implementation that can grow or shrink in size. It provides constant-time access and
   amortized constant-time addition and removal.
    - It can be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed.
    - ArrayList inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.
    - ArrayList can not be used for primitive types, like int, char, etc. We need a wrapper class for such cases


3. **LinkedList**: A doubly-linked list implementation that supports constant-time addition and removal, but with O(n)
   access time.
   LinkedList is an excellent choice when you need to perform frequent insertions and deletions at both ends or in the
   middle of the list, and when you don't need to access elements by index often. If you require constant-time access to
   elements, an ArrayList might be a better choice.

Since a LinkedList acts as a dynamic array and we do not have to specify the size while creating it, the size of the
list automatically increases when we dynamically add and remove items.

4. **Stack:** A Last-In-First-Out **(LIFO)** data structure. Supports constant-time push, pop, and peek operations.

5. **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out **(FIFO)** data structure. Supports constant-time enqueue, dequeue, and peek 
   operations.

PriorityQueue: A priority-based queue that maintains elements in sorted order based on their priority. Supports O(log n)
insertion and removal.

HashSet: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Provides O(1) average time for add, remove, and contains
operations.

HashMap: A key-value map that uses hashing to store data. Provides O(1) average time for put, get, and remove
operations.

TreeMap: A sorted key-value map that uses a Red-Black Tree for storage. Provides O(log n) time for put, get, and remove
operations.

Graphs: Data structures that represent relationships between nodes (vertices) and edges. Can be represented as adjacency
lists or adjacency matrices.
