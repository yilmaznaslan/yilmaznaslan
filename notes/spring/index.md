# Spring Ecosystem

- **spring-boot-starter-web**: This is primarily for building web applications, including RESTful applications, with Spring MVC. It provides the essentials to get a web application up and running, such as embedded Tomcat, Spring MVC, and Jackson (for JSON processing).

- **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: This is for integrating Spring applications with data access technologies using JPA (Java Persistence API). It provides things like Hibernate (as the default JPA implementation), Spring Data JPA, a transaction manager, and other JPA-related dependencies.
