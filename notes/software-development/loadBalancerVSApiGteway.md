# What is the difference between a load balancer and an API gateway?

Load balancer and API gateway are both components of modern distributed systems that serve different purposes. Here's an
overview of their main differences:

## 1) Purpose & Functionality

**Load Balancer**:

- The primary function of Load balancers is distributing the load among servers and monitoring the health of
  those servers. They help
  maintain high availability and fault tolerance but do not typically handle application-level concerns.
- By doing so optimize resource utilization, minimize response time, and ensure the availability of the application
  is aimed
- It balances the load by using various algorithms such as Round Robin, Least Connections, or IP Hash, among others.
  API Gateway:

**An API gateway**

- serves as an entry point for external API consumers, acting as a single point of interaction for all
  microservices within a system.
- API gateways, in addition to routing requests, offer more advanced functionality, such as request/response
  transformation, API versioning, caching, logging, and security features like **authentication** and **authorization**.
- It is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation. It also handles cross-cutting concerns
  such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request/response transformation.
-

## 2) Position in the architecture:

**Load Balancer**

- A load balancer is typically placed between the clients and the servers, ensuring that incoming traffic is evenly
  distributed among the available servers.

**API Gateway**

- An API gateway is positioned at the edge of the system, serving as a facade for multiple microservices. It routes
  incoming API requests from clients to the appropriate microservices, potentially aggregating or transforming responses
  before returning them to the client.

## Summary:

In summary, while both load balancers and API gateways play a role in managing traffic, they serve different purposes.
Load balancers primarily focus on distributing incoming traffic to maintain high availability and optimal performance,
while API gateways provide an entry point for API clients and handle additional application-level concerns. In many
distributed systems, both components work together to ensure a reliable and performant infrastructure.
