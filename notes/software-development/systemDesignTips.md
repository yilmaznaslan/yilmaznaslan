# 5 Tips for System Design Interviews

## 1) Clarify the product requirements and scope
Avoid going into detail prematurely: When discussing a system, wait for the interviewer to ask for more detail or for a
natural pause in the conversation before delving deeper. This prevents wasting time and potential backtracking if the
interviewer isn't interested in that level of detail.

## 2) Don't have a set architecture in mind 
Be flexible and open to adapting your design based on the specific requirements
of the problem. Relying on a predetermined architecture may not be suitable for all situations and can hinder your
ability to respond effectively to changes in requirements.

## 3) Keep it simple (KISS principle)
Avoid overcomplicating parts of the system and maintain a consistent level of detail
throughout the design. Regularly take a step back to evaluate the whole system and consider whether any components can
be **simplified** or extended to other parts.

## 4) Make points with justifications
When discussing design choices, always provide a clear rationale for your decisions.
Avoid making statements without backing them up, as this may come across as poorly thought out and negatively impact
your interview performance.

## 5) Be aware of current technologies
Demonstrate knowledge of various technologies, tools, and solutions that can be
applied to different parts of the system. Showcasing familiarity with these technologies can help convey your expertise
and suggest that you would require less time and testing to implement features in a real-world scenario.
