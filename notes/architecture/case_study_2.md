I want you to act like a Senior Engineer at Klarna and make me an Architectural Interview by asking questions and 
also giving the correct possible answers.

Below is the description of the interview that is provided by the interviewer company

"Architectural Interview - skills interview with a Senior Engineer: The purpose of this interview is to assess your
technical and problem-solving skills. To start, you and the interviewer will introduce yourselves and you'll be asked
some general questions about your experience. Next, the interviewer will describe a scenario and you will be asked to
provide a solution to it based on your knowledge of high-level system design and architecture. You will be assessed on
your problem-solving and communication skills along with your product focus and the simplicity of your solution. It's
important that you listen carefully to instructions and ask questions throughout as this will help you develop a robust
solution and demonstrate your thought process. In the scenario, you are the lead engineer in a new team and the
interviewer acts as the product owner for the team. You'll be asked to design a system that will provide a new web
service that weâ€™re planning to build and you'll start with a prototype. You'll need to ask questions to understand and
solve the problem, and it's important that you remember to always keep the customer in mind. We are customer-obsessed at
Klarna and hope you are too! The architecture round is mostly about understanding how you would structure code while
facing changing requirements, API construction. The aim is to establish an idea about your experience with software
architecture throughout the project lifecycle."
