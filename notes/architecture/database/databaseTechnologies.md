# Database technologies  and use cases

Here are some real-life application scenarios for both **relational** and **non-relational** databases:

### 1) Relational Database Use Cases:

- **E-commerce Platforms**:

  An e-commerce platform requires a well-structured database to store and manage product
  information, customer data, orders, and inventory. Relational databases can ensure data consistency and support
  complex
  transactions, such as placing orders, applying discounts, and managing inventory levels.


- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems**: CRM systems need to manage structured data like customer details,
  communication history, and sales opportunities. Using a relational database allows for easy querying and reporting, as
  well as maintaining referential integrity between tables.

- **Banking and Financial Applications**: Financial institutions require a high level of data consistency and
  transaction
  support. Relational databases can help manage complex relationships between accounts, transactions, and customers,
  ensuring data accuracy and security.

- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems**: ERP systems manage various aspects of a business, such as human
  resources,
  finance, and supply chain. They require a structured database that can handle complex relationships, transactions, and
  reporting.

### 2) Non-relational Database Use Cases:

- **Social Media Platforms**: Social media platforms handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data,
  such as
  user profiles, posts, comments, and multimedia. NoSQL databases can scale horizontally and provide the high write and
  read throughput needed for this type of application.

- **IoT and Sensor Data**: Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate massive amounts of data in various formats and at
  high
  velocity. NoSQL databases can store this heterogeneous data efficiently and enable real-time processing and analytics.

- **Recommendation Engines**: Recommendation engines used by e-commerce platforms, content streaming services, or
  advertising
  platforms need to process and analyze large volumes of user behavior data to generate personalized recommendations.
  NoSQL databases can handle the high throughput and flexible data model required for this type of application.

- **Gaming Applications**: Online gaming platforms often require low-latency data access for user profiles, game state,
  and
  player interactions. NoSQL databases, such as key-value stores or document stores, can provide the performance and
  scalability needed for these use cases.
