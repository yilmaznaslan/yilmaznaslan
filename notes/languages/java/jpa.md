## What is ORM ? Object Relational Mapping

From a programming perspective, the ORM layer is an adapter layer: it adapts the language of object graphs to the
language of SQL and relational tables. The ORM layer allows object-oriented developers to build software that persists
data without ever leaving the object-oriented paradigm.

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): ORM is a programming technique that maps objects to relational databases. It eliminates
the need for developers to write complex SQL queries by automatically translating object-oriented operations to the
underlying database. ORM frameworks handle the object-relational mapping, allowing developers to work with objects
directly. This simplifies data access and improves productivity.

## JPA( Java Persistence API)

## Hibernate ORM

Hibernate ORM is the de facto standard Jakarta Persistence (formerly known as JPA) implementation and offers you the
full breadth of an Object Relational Mapper. Hibernate eliminates much of the boilerplate code required for data access,
simplifies complex mappings, and offers features like caching, lazy loading, and transaction management.

When using Hibernate, developers define entity classes that represent database tables and annotate them with JPA
annotations. Hibernate then handles the mapping and provides APIs for querying and persisting objects.
