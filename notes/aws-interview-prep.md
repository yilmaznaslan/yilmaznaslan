Questions on algorithms

- understand the time & space complexity of your solution. Be able to reason throught tade ofss between the optimum solution

What to expect in AWS SDE interviews

Coding problems on arrays, strings, hashing, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and greedy patterns.
A mix of single-file solutions and small system-design/architecture prompts at higher levels.
Expect time-pressure practice, clear problem statements, and justifications of complexity.
Strong emphasis on writing clean, testable code and explaining your approach aloud.

- ** Hard sliding window** problem ?
- Tree based problem ismilar to "Burn Binary Tree"

1. Algorithm / Pattern Focus

The response mentions the typical SDE I patterns they saw:

- tree traversel, greedy algortimhs, dynamic programming, sortin g, sets, lists, maps, arrays
- Sliding Window on Strings/Arrays → work on substring/subarray problems, max/min window, dynamic lengths.
- two pointers, backtracking
- BFS/DFS on Grids/Graphs → classic grid traversal, connected components, shortest paths.
- Heaps for "Top K"-style problems → priority queues, Kth largest/smallest, merge K sorted arrays.
