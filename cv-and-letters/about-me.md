# About me

I am a software developer with 4 years of experience working in IT consultancy company. I have worked mainly as Java backend developer in large scale customer facing projects. Even though I am a backend-focused developer, I also have some experience in web app development using React and react native. However, I have noticed having only experience in Java doesn’t add much value to me much. I just spend my days implementing business features in backend , doing log analysis & bugs etc. I need a new challenge in my career to boost my chances in the job market. I thought becoming a fullstack developer would be a good way to achieve. I also noticed I haven’t worked with nosql databases or elasticsearch much which I notice often in the job ads. But now I am a bit stuck in my career at my job. I still work as java developer in my job and I can’t change it easily in the company. I want to equip my self with modern tech stack such as [node.js](http://node.js) react, elasticsearch etc. But Apperatnyl I can’t learn these during my job so I need to to something on my free time. But I dont\# find a motivation for that. I need a goal. And given that I have done these, it is still hard to convince interviewer person by selling these as part time hustles

My Achievements

* Personal  
  I managed to change my career path to software development even though I have my educational background in mechanical engineering at the university. This wasn’t that easy because I had to prove my skills and my passion to be able


Strenghts

* **Problem-solving & adaptability**  
  I can quickly adapt & onboard myself into new projects or new tech stack(Ex: my mobile and be able to solve complex problems. This is one of the things I have benefited from by working as consultantcy  
* **Continuous learning & tech curiosity**  
  I actively explore new tools and AI technologies to improve products and processes. Just because I wanted to, I left backend development and started frontend development from scratch  
* I am good at context switching when working


Weakness 

- **Asking for help**. In the past, I tried to solve complex problems alone instead of asking for help early. I have learned that collaborating sooner saves time and helps the team more  
- My strength is more in the backend. So when it comes to pixel-perfect **frontend details, I sometimes need extra time**. But I have improved a lot through recent projects

My Biggest failure

- Early in my student times, azure costed 600€ to me when I was experimenting with it during university times

	

Agile / Multi-disciplinary teams

- Yes, in my recent project(s) I collaborated with front-end and backend engineers, designers, product managers, and QA engineers to build user-facing features. We worked in sprints, with daily stand-up and reviews 

What motivates you at work

- Learning and integrating new tech like AI, I have even acquired a developer certificate   
- Adding something new to my resume  
- Building user-centere solutions , scaling systems

Q: What have you struggled with most in your current job?

“Early on, I sometimes tried to solve everything myself instead of collaborating. I’ve since improved by proactively discussing problems and dividing work effectively with teammates.”

	

One Thing I have implemented 

I improved the error handling mechanism in microservice architecture

Why [Mobile.de](http://Mobile.de) ?

- Impact at scale  
- Consumer-first approach  
- [Mobile.de](http://Mobile.de) is one of the biggest car marketplace millions of active user. It would satisfix me a lot seeing the impact of our work 

Why I want to change jobs

* I want the opportunity to **take long-term ownership** of a product and make a meaningful impact, rather than rotating frequently across multiple client projects.  
* Consultancy environments often face **high turnover and limited continuity**, which affects code stability and makes achieving consistent standards challenging.  
* I am seeking **larger-scale, high-performance systems** where I can contribute to architecture, code quality, and maintainability, not just implement isolated features.  
* I want to work in **international, collaborative teams** where I feel fully integrated and can learn from diverse perspectives.

Problems I have faced in my career and how I have solved it,

1) Technical challenges: Bugs( At Miele I establish debugging sessions with different stakeholders, everyone is trying to   
2) Collaboration challenges: My recent startup project at Vunapay, our business stake holder(CEO) was not very well informed about the time schedule of the things of what he wants to implement. I have openly mentioned that the the plan was not realisitc

Questions

- Team setup ? Language?  Working mode ? Personal development opportunities?

Things I header but didn’t have change yet to work

- GraphQL, Golang, terraform

* Experience with multi-threading, concurrency, and caching.

# Qualifications

\[ \-  \] Experience with multi-threading, concurrency, and caching.  
\[ \- \] You have profound knowledge of industry standards in web authentication, authorization, and identity management (like OAuth2, OpenIdConnect, SAML) and/or frameworks and products (e.g. Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito...).

# My Experience

Vunapay

I joined VunaPay and addressed major structural issues: business logic embedded in Cloud Run functions, a monolithic Flutter frontend, and no clear environment separation. I rebuilt the stack with a modular Node.js/Express backend and a React Native frontend, introduced SQL data modeling, integrated Clerk for authentication, and set up CI/CD. I also established separate staging and production GCP projects with isolated Cloud SQL and services to stabilize deployments
