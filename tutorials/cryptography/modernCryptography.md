# Modern Cryptography

## Cryptography Primitives

Cryptography primitives are nothing but the tools and techniques in Cryptography that can be selectively used to provide a set of desired security services âˆ’

- Encryption
- Hash functions
- Message Authentication codes (MAC)
- Digital Signatures

Cryptographic primitives are intricately related and they are often combined to achieve a set of desired security services from a cryptosystem.
