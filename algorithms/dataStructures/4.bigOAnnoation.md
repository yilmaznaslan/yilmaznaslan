# Big O Annotation

In computer science, Big O notation O(1), O(n) is used to describe the performance or time complexity of an algorithm.- i.e how the performance scaled as the amount of data grows.

## Common Big-O complexities
- O(1) -> constant time. 
  Does n't depend on the size of the data. Example
```java
list.get(5) // Accessing element by the index in ArrayList
```
- O(n) â†’ Linear time.
Performance grows proportionally with data size. Example:

for (int x : list) { ... } // Loop through n elements
