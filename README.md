# Hi there

I am a software developer from Berlin mainly working on developing backend services for an IoT Application
I am orginally stuied Mechanical Engineering durign my bachelor and master studies but I had always had increasing
interest in programming

I have first started coding through Arduino boards. The interaction of electronics and coding sparked my interest in
coding and kept me coding on embedded chips quite a while. At some point during the senior year of my bachelor it became
clear to me that I wanted to professionlie in coding and sonftware development. However at that time I didn't have
enough creadits to be eligble to apply for a CS master program so I ended up in mechanical engineerin again.

During these times I always wanted to keep coding so I select all the selectable courses that were somewhat including
coding. After working as a working student in various positions like embbedd programming and python, I finally made my
breakthrough in 2021 September by starting work as a backend developer at IT Consulting company.
