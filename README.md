# Yilmaz Naci Aslan

## 👋 About Me

I am a software developer with **4 years of experience** working in IT consultancy, primarily as a Java backend developer on large-scale customer-facing projects.

While my focus has been on backend development, I also have experience in web application development using React and React Native. I'm passionate about continuous learning and technology exploration, which has led me to expand my skill set beyond Java.

I'm currently transitioning to become a fullstack developer and exploring modern tech stacks including Node.js, React, and Elasticsearch.
