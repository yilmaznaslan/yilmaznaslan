Both BDD (Behavior Driven Development) and TDD (Test Driven Development) are testing methodologies used in software
development. Both aim to improve software quality and reliability by introducing a structured approach to testing.

In unit testing, the testing focus is on testing small and isolated pieces of code, usually at the function or method
level. This allows for faster feedback and easier debugging of issues. Assertions are an important part of unit testing,
as they provide a way to check that the expected output is produced for a given input.

When it comes to using assertions in BDD and TDD, the difference lies in the way the tests are written and the language
used to describe them. BDD is a more high-level approach to testing that emphasizes on the behavior of the system rather
than the implementation details. In BDD, tests are written in a more natural language that describes the behavior of the
system in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

In contrast, TDD is a more technical approach to testing that emphasizes on the correctness of the implementation. In
TDD, tests are written before the actual code is written, and the code is then developed iteratively to pass the tests.

In terms of assertions, both BDD and TDD use assertions to check the expected output of a given input. However,
BDD-style assertions are often more descriptive and focus on the behavior of the system, while TDD-style assertions tend
to be more technical and focus on the implementation details.

In summary, the choice of whether to use BDD or TDD assertions in unit testing depends on the testing approach used, and
the language and style preferred by the development team. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and
the choice ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of the project.
