# What is NodeJS

Node.js is a free and open-source server-side runtime environment that allows developers to build fast and scalable
applications using JavaScript. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Node.js is built on top of the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which provides a high-performance execution environment for
JavaScript code. Node.js can be used for various purposes, including building web applications, network applications,
command-line tools, and more. It has a large and active community of developers and offers a vast library of modules and
packages through its package manager, npm.
