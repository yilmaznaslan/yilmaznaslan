# What are most used libraries for writining unit tests in java

There are several popular libraries for writing unit tests in Java, including:

- **JUnit**: This is the most widely used testing framework for Java. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for writing
  and
  running tests, and supports a wide range of assertions and annotations.

- **Mockito**: This is a popular mocking library for Java. It allows developers to create mock objects for testing, which
  can
  simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled environment.

- **AssertJ**: This library provides a fluent API for writing assertions, which can make test code more readable and
  easier to
  understand.

- TestNG: This is an alternative testing framework to JUnit, with additional features such as support for data-driven
  testing, parallel testing, and more advanced test configuration options.

- Hamcrest: This is a matching library that provides a set of matchers for testing values, which can be used in
  conjunction with JUnit or other testing frameworks.

- PowerMock: This is a testing library that extends Mockito and other testing frameworks, allowing developers to test
  code
  that would otherwise be difficult to test, such as static or final methods.

These are just a few examples of the many testing libraries available for Java. The choice of library ultimately depends
on the specific needs and requirements of the project, as well as the preferences and experience of the development
team.

## Which library is used preferred more in Java projects Junit or AssertJ ?

JUnit was more widely used in Java projects compared to AssertJ. This is primarily because JUnit has been the de facto
standard for unit testing in Java for many years, and its latest version, JUnit 5, continues to be a popular choice.

JUnit is a mature testing framework with a large community, extensive documentation, and wide-ranging support for
various IDEs and build tools. The long history of JUnit has led to widespread adoption, and many developers are familiar
with its syntax and best practices.

On the other hand, AssertJ is a more recent library focused on providing a fluent and expressive API for assertions.
Although it is less popular than JUnit, AssertJ has been gaining traction, especially among developers who prefer its
readability and flexibility. AssertJ is often used in conjunction with JUnit, enhancing the assertions while still
relying on JUnit for the test framework itself.

In conclusion, as of September 2021, JUnit was more widely used in Java projects than AssertJ. However, it's essential
to note that they serve different purposes and can be used together. Developers often choose to use JUnit for the
testing framework and AssertJ for writing more expressive assertions. Current adoption trends may change, so it's always
a good idea to research the latest data and trends before making a decision.
