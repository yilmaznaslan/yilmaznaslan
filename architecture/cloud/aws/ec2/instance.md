# Error: Failed to detach network interface eni-0194c551d417b3c00 from instance i-0f4b73497fecaf2b3.

How to solve the error message
> Failed to detach network interface eni-0194c551d417b3c00 from instance i-0f4b73497fecaf2b3.
> The network interface at device index 0 and networkCard index 0 cannot be detached.

The error message "Failed to detach network interface eni-0194c551d417b3c00 from instance i-0f4b73497fecaf2b3. The
network interface at device index 0 and networkCard index 0 cannot be detached." indicates that there was an issue when
trying to detach a network interface from an EC2 instance.

This error can occur if the network interface that you are trying to detach is the primary network interface for the
instance. In general, the primary network interface for an EC2 instance cannot be detached while the instance is
running, as doing so would result in the instance losing its network connectivity.

To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following options:

1) Stop the instance: If you need to detach the primary network interface, you can stop the instance first and then
   detach
   the network interface. To stop the instance, you can use the "Stop" command in the EC2 console or CLI. Once the
   instance
   is stopped, you should be able to detach the network interface.

2) Detach a secondary network interface: If you need to detach a network interface from an instance but cannot detach
   the
   primary network interface, you can try detaching a secondary network interface instead. You can check the network
   interfaces attached to the instance in the EC2 console or CLI and determine which network interface is not the
   primary
   one. Once you have identified the correct network interface, you can try detaching it.

3) Reboot the instance: In some cases, rebooting the instance can resolve issues with detaching network interfaces. You
   can
   use the "Reboot" command in the EC2 console or CLI to reboot the instance, and then try detaching the network
   interface
   again after the instance has restarted.
