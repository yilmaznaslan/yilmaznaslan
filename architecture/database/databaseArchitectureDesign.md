# Things to consider during database architecture design

What are the principles to be used considered in database architecture design

When discussing the database architecture and design, it's critical to understand the needs of your application in
detail. Here are some questions you might ask and potential answers to look for:

#### What is the nature and volume of the data?

- The type of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) and its volume (GB, TB, PB) can influence your database
  choice. Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) are great for structured data with complex relationships, while
  NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) handle unstructured or semi-structured data and scale more easily.

#### What are the query requirements?

- Understanding the query patterns and requirements is essential. If your application requires complex joins and
  transactions, a relational database would be more suitable. If your workload primarily consists of simple read and
  write
  operations, a NoSQL solution may be sufficient.

#### How critical is consistency vs. availability?

- Depending on the nature of your application, you may prioritize data consistency or high availability. For
  applications
  needing strong consistency (e.g., financial applications), a relational database would be ideal. For applications that
  can tolerate eventual consistency but require high availability (e.g., social media), a NoSQL solution might be
  better.

#### What are the scalability needs?

- If your application is expected to grow rapidly, you need a database that can scale easily. NoSQL databases typically
  offer better horizontal scalability than relational databases.

#### What are the data retention policies?

- Depending on the industry and type of data, there might be specific regulations about data retention that you need to
  consider.

#### What are the security requirements?

- Depending on the sensitivity of the data, you may require certain security features, such as encryption at rest or in
  transit, fine-grained access control, audit logs, etc.

#### What is the disaster recovery plan?
- It's essential to consider how your data will be backed up and how you will recover from potential disasters.
