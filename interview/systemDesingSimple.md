# 3 Layer Software Architecture

Draw a 3-tier software

- and make it highly available
- scale it, find bottlenecks

A 3-tier software architecture typically consists of the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer** (Client Tier): This is the user interface of the application, where users interact with the
   software. It can be a web-based frontend, mobile app, or desktop application.

Application Layer (Business Logic Tier): This layer contains the core logic of the application, responsible for
processing user requests, performing calculations, and handling data manipulations. This is where the application server
resides.

Data Layer (Data Tier): This layer is responsible for storing and managing the data used by the application. It
typically includes databases, file systems, or other data storage systems.

### To make this architecture highly available:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Implement **load balancing to distribute user requests** across multiple instances of the
   frontend application. This can be achieved using cloud-based services like **AWS Elastic Load Balancer** or **Google
   Cloud Load Balancing**.

2. **Application Layer**: **Deploy multiple instances** of the application server across different geographical
   regions or availability zones. Use load balancing to distribute requests evenly among these instances. Consider using
   containerization (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) for simplified deployment
   and management.

3. **Data Layer**: Use **database replication** or clustering to ensure data redundancy and high availability. For
   example, you can set up a master-slave replication architecture for databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

### To scale the architecture and find bottlenecks:

1. Monitor the performance of each layer to identify areas that require optimization. Use application performance
   monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic, AppDynamics, or Datadog for this purpose.

2. Optimize database queries and indexes to reduce query times and improve performance.

3. Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce the load on the application and database layers.

4. Consider using auto-scaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances for each layer based on demand.

5. Perform load testing and stress testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify bottlenecks in the system.
